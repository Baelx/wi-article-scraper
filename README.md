# wi-article-scraper

This project will use a PDF scraping tool to collect the most boring and petty-sounding articles from the Westmount Independant newspaper. Their website - on which they feature an up-to-date archive of all editions - will be monitored for updates using Python as well.

## Tools/Libraries:
